# National Public Drone Infrastructure & First Responder Pilot Act (NP-DIRPA)

**Enabling rapid, safe public drone pilots for infrastructure and first response—accountable, open, and privacy‑centric.**

---
> **Why it matters:**  
> - **Faster bridge fixes & safer roads** (drone inspections in minutes, not weeks)  
> - **Quicker search-and-rescue** (find lost hikers or fire victims in half the time)  
> - **Rural first-responders get cutting-edge tools** without breaking local budgets  
> - **Built-in privacy protections**: 30-day auto-delete, warrant-only face ID  
> - **Open dashboards** so the public sees every flight and audit

## Overview

The **National Public Drone Infrastructure & First Responder Pilot Act (NP‑DIRPA)** establishes a federal framework for piloting and scaling drone use in public infrastructure inspection and emergency response. NP‑DIRPA creates a two‑tier sandbox for agencies to safely experiment, mandates blue‑team/red‑team air‑safety audits, and requires strict privacy, transparency, and open‑data standards.

## What Does NP‑DIRPA Do?

- **Creates a Federal Drone Sandbox:**  
  Tier‑1 (infrastructure, VLOS) and Tier‑2 (BVLOS, emergency corridors) pilots for public agencies.
- **Accelerates Safe Adoption:**  
  FAA/OSTP fast lane, NEPA categorical exclusion for low‑risk pilots, micro‑grants for rural/tribal/local agencies.
- **Mandates Air‑Safety Board:**  
  Mixed blue‑team/red‑team audits, ADS‑B spoof detection, quarterly drills, and continuous improvement.
- **Open Data & Transparency:**  
  Public flight logs (with 72‑hr delay), audit trails, and hash‑chained KPI dashboards.
- **Privacy & Civil Liberties by Design:**  
  30‑day retention cap, warrant requirement for biometrics, redaction ledger, and public appeals.
- **Opt‑In for States, Tribes, & Locals:**  
  Shared services, rural/tribal priority lane, and cost‑share model for underserved areas.
- **Audit & Sunset:**  
  GAO spot audits, ROI annex (“downtime prevented,” “lives saved”), and sunset/review provisions.
